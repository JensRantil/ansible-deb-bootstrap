========================
Ansible server bootstrap
========================

This is an Ansible playbook of an Ubuntu/Debian server bootstrapping
process. The playbook is based off of Bryan Kennedy's "[My First 5
Minutes On A Server; Or, Essential Security for Linux
Servers](http://plusbryan.com/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server-or-essential-security-for-linux-servers)".

I thought the blog post would be a great initial test of how it is to
work with Ansible. The code is currently highly unstable (and might not
even work) at the moment. Pull requests are welcome!
